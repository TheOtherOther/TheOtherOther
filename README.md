Hi there, my name is Andre👋
- 👨‍🎓 I am currently training as an IT specialist for application development
- 🔭 I am looking for small projects that I can get involved in to develop my skills and knowledge.

I would say that my favorite languages are:
  - C#
  - Java
  - Javascript

but I'm not afraid to take on the challenge of a completely new language.

So if you have tasks in your projects that are beginner friendly. you can contact me at:
